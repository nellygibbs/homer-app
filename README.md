# HOMER | MERN-stack app

## Introduction

HOMER is a MERN-stack app that sourced from an API. It was created for home buyers to view houses and add new houses they are interested in. It is inspired by my own personal life experience of buying my first home. It can be very daunting trying to remember all the houses you've viewed, as well as the details of the home. This app's goal is to help home buyers keep track of the houses they've viewed so they can have all the one's that they're interested located in a mutual location.
